Hi! Welcome! This is my second project in The Odin Project: Fullstack JavaScript Path. This is where I applied what I have learned so far about HTML and JavaScript. 

This is a game of rock, paper, scissor. Basically, you will play with the computer and the first one who will have a score of 5 wins. 

For the time being, you can only play using the console and typing your pick (rock, paper, or scissors) in the pop-up window.
